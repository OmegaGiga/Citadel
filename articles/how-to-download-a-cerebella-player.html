            When confronted with the issue of a solo Cerebella (or a team that so happens to have her, but solo for simplicity's sake), it is easy for one to want to panic.
            <br>
            Do not panic. There is no reason to panic.
            Instead, there are proper ways to succeed upon the incitement of violence by a Cerebella.
            </p>        
            <h3 style="text-align:left;">These include:</h3>
             <ul style="margin:0;font-size:9px;text-align:left;">
                <li>Taking note of the most common actions performed on round-start; You want to see if they attempt to rush down on you, or back away.</li>
                <li>Zoning for quite a bit to see if they will attempt to reflect any projectiles; This is to make sure that the Cerebella is awful at avoiding the zone.</li>
                <li>If you are a character with the ability to fly, don't let the lady catch you.</li>
                <li>Punish her charges; Squigly is great at this.</li>
                <li>Delete her; Why can't you die!?</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">
